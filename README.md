# ModularHapticSystem
This project has an intention to develop a multipurpose modular haptic device that can control almost everything, it must be cheap, easy to build and implement in other projects. The analysis considering a complete engineering approach, so you can expect a mathematical, programming and electronics considerations, of course, I don't expect a complete background or understanding of some parts of the analysis, so I will add a little of theory before.   The main idea is to present a structure that can measure position and orientation of a specific module, these modules can be the ones presented here or one of your creation! This is another nice goal of the project, you can create an add easily your own haptic devices for your own needs, the aspects of creation can be a little difficult, for this reason, I will present at least four modules of my creation with applications in robotics, like controls for robotics arms or surgery robots, perception in virtual environments and pc control.

Here you can find the respective files (CAD and codes), for a more especific and detailed information of how its work and how to assembly, please go to:
